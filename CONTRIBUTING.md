## Proposed Branching Strategy

Our branching is as follows:

feature --> develop  --> test --> main

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  feature[Feature]
  develop[Develop]
  test[Test]
  main[Main<br/>prod]

  feature -->|GH Actions:<br/>Linting, Unit tests, PR checks| develop
  develop -->|Tests:<br/>Feature branch, API Integration| oc_dev
  develop --> test
  test -->|Tests:<br/>E2E, staging DB,<br/>Smoke tests, high coverage| oc_test
  test --> main
  main -->|Tests:<br/>Basic smoke test, monitoring| oc_prod

```

### Creating a new feature 

1. Ensure you have a ticket assigned
1. Create a branch off of develop
1. Make small commits, ensure your feature is accompanied by tests

### Merging into develop

1. When you are satisfied with your local feature branch, it's time to merge into develop.
1. Push your code to github, this will trigger our testing pipeline
1. With all tests passed, create a PR. Once approved it will be merged into develop.
1. After the changes are merged in, our development namespace on openshift will automatically re-deploy with the newly merged features.
